Hello All
Leetcode has started a new challenge ,where they post a question everyday .
It's called May-leetcoding Challenge.
Problems appear at midnight, Pacific Daylight Time. 
You'll have one day to correctly solve each problem for 10 LeetCoins. 
After that, you can still solve it, however, you won't get any LeetCoins. A new problem will appear each day.
Do provide your feedback on codes that i post .
The codes might not be clean ,but i am sure you can easily understand because it's written by a newbie :)
